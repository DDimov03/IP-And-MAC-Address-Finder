IP Address Resolver

This is a simple Python script that resolves the IP address of a given domain name using the socket module. It provides a function get_ip_address(domain_name) that takes a domain name as input and returns the corresponding IP address.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the script.py file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the following command:

shell 
----------------------------------------------------------------
python script.py
----------------------------------------------------------------
Enter the domain name when prompted.

The script will attempt to resolve the IP address of the provided domain name.

If the IP address is successfully retrieved, it will be displayed in the terminal.

If the IP address retrieval fails, an appropriate error message will be shown.

Example:
----------------------------------------------------------------
python
Copy code
import socket

def get_ip_address(domain_name):
    try:
        ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(domain_name)
        return ip_address
    except socket.gaierror:
        return None

# Example usage
domain_name = input("Enter the domain name: ")
ip_address = get_ip_address(domain_name)

if ip_address:
    print(f"The IP address of {domain_name} is: {ip_address}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve the IP address for {domain_name}")
